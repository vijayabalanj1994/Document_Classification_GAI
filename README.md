# Content Search Engine

## Project Overview
In this project, I aim to address the technical challenge of classifying news articles for a content search engine. The objective is to design and implement a machine learning model capable of automatically categorizing news articles into predefined topics or classes, optimizing the search engine's ability to efficiently retrieve and deliver relevant content to users.
