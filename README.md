# TopicTagger AI

## Project Overview

The **TopicTagger AI** project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for classifying news articles into predefined categories. The aim is to design a model that enhances search engine capabilities by efficiently retrieving and delivering relevant content to users. This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.

## Features

- **Dataset Preparation:**
  - Utilizes the AG NEWS dataset for multi-class classification.
  - Efficient tokenization and vocabulary building using PyTorch's TorchText utilities.
  - Balanced train/validation/test dataset splits for robust model evaluation.

- **Model Architecture:**
  - A lightweight feed-forward neural network (NN) with `nn.EmbeddingBag` for efficient embedding representation.
  - Two-layer architecture optimized for text classification.
  - Weight initialization for stable training performance.

- **Training Pipeline:**
  - Gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling to enhance training stability.
  - Tracks validation accuracy and saves the best-performing model during training.

- **Visualization:**
  - Embedding visualization using t-SNE, showcasing how the model groups similar content.
  - Interactive 3D plots generated with Plotly for deeper insights.

- **Prediction:**
  - A simple and user-friendly pipeline for predicting categories of new articles.
  - Markdown visualization for presenting results clearly.

## Results

- **Accuracy:**
  - Pretrained Model Accuracy: ~81.7% on the test set.

- **Embedding Visualization:**
  - Visualizations highlight clear separations between different news categories.
